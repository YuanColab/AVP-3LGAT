Peptides with different dilution concentrations were mixed with SARS-CoV-2 (100 TCID50) for 30 min and then added to monolayer VERO-E6 cells. After adsorption at 37 ～C, the supernatant was removed, and 0.9% methyl cellulose was overlaid on the cells. After 72 h, the plates were fixed and stained. Plaques were counted by fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde and staining with 0.1% crystal violet.","We used an HCoV-OC43 infection mouse model to further investigate the potential prophylactic effect of EK1C4 in clinical applications via the intranasal administration route (Fig. 6f, g). In the OC43-infected mouse model, we treated newborn mice with EK1C4 at a single dose of 0.5 mg/kg 0.5 h (Pre-0.5), 2 h (Pre-2), 4 h (Pre-4), 12 (Pre-12) and 24 h (Pre-24) before challenging with HCoV-OC43 at 100 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose). Starting from 4 days＊ post-infection (dpi), the body weight of mice in the viral control group decreased significantly along with 100% mortality (Fig. 6f, g). The final survival rates of mice in Pre-0.5, Pre-2, Pre-4, Pre-12 and Pre-24 groups were 100%, 100%, 100%, 83 and 0%, respectively (Fig. 6f, g). In contrast, EK1 with a single dose of 20 mg/kg via nasal administration exhibited very promising prophylactic effect in the Pre-0.5 h and Pre-1 h groups, whereas all mice in the EK1-Pre-2 h group eventually died similarly to the mice in the viral control group (Supplementary information, Fig. S5). These results suggested that EK1C4 has better stability, antiviral activity, and prolonged half-life in the airway environment when compared with EK1. We then tested the therapeutic effect of EK1C4 0.5 h (Post-0.5 group) and 2 h (Post-2 group) after HCoV-OC43 infection (Fig. 6h, i). The Post-0.5 group and Post-2 group mice showed 100% and 16.7% survival rate, respectively, suggesting that EK1C4 harbors good therapeutic effect after a short period of HCoV-OC43 infection, possibly resulting from the establishment of HCoVOC43 infection in mouse brain where EK1C4 cannot get through the blood brain barrier via nasal administration.14 As shown in Supplementary information, Fig. S6, high viral titer was detected in brains of all 5 mice in Pre-24 group and 4 out of 5 mice in Post-2 group, but was not detected in brain tissues of all mice in Pre-0.5, Pre-2, Pre-4, and Post-0.5 groups, while only moderate level of viral titer was detected in brain tissue in one of the 5 mice in Pre- 12 group (Supplementary information, Fig. S6a, b). Similar to those in the viral control mice, mice in Pre-24 and Post-2 groups exhibited similar histopathological changes in brain tissues, including vacuolation, degeneration, and infiltration.

Briefly, 60 米l of a serially twofold diluted peptide was incubated with 60 米l (120 TCID50) of MERS-CoV in MEM medium supplemented with 2% FBS (M-2 medium) in duplicate wells of 96-well plates for ~60 min at room temperature. One hundred microliters of the peptide/MERSCoV mixtures was then transferred into confluent Calu-3 cells grown in 96-well plates. Wells of Calu-3 cells cultured with M-2 medium with and without virus were included in these assays as positive and negative controls, respectively. While the advanced CPE of Calu-3 cells could develop within 24 to 36 hours in response to MERS-CoV infection at higher multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of 1 or 0.1, we did not observe any prominent formation of CPE until ~ 60 to 72 hours after infection at an estimated MOI of ~ 0.001. Hence, to more accurately measure the efficacy of peptide inhibitors against MERS-CoV infection, we harvested the supernatants at 72 hours and quantified infectious virus titers by the standard Vero E6每based infectivity assays and expressed the titers as log10 TCID50/ml.","To evaluate the prophylactic and therapeutic potentials of EK1 against MERS-CoV infection, we took advantage of the well-characterized transgenic (Tg) mice globally expressing human dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) viral receptor. We treated mice with 200 米g of EK1 or with PBS 30 min before or after challenge with MERS-CoV at 104 TCID50. Likewise, the weight loss of Tg mice treated with EK1 before or after MERS-CoV challenge was insignificant and rapidly recovered at 16 dpi, while untreated mice progressively lost significant weight before succumbing to infection within 9 dpi with 100% mortality (Fig. 3, H to J). In contrast, the survival rates in the EK1 prophylactic and therapeutic groups were 100 and 75%, respectively (Fig. 3, H to J).

Meanwhile, we tested the viral titers in brains of mice of all groups at 5 dpi. Infectious virus was readily detectable in the viral control group, whereas infectious virus titers were below the limit of detection (2 log TCID50/g) in the EK1 prophylactic mice or very low in the EK1 therapeutic mice (Fig. 3G).

The fused cell was much larger by at least twofold than the unfused cell, and the intensity of fluorescence in the fused cell was weaker than that of the unfused cell as a result of the diffusion of EGFP from one cell to two or more cells (see Fig. 5a). The percent inhibition of cell每cell fusion was calculated using the following formula: (1 - (E - N)/(P - N)) x 100. ＆E＊ represents the % cell每cell fusion in the experimental group. ＆P＊ represents the % cell每cell fusion in the positive control group, to which no inhibitor was added. ＆N＊ is the % cell每cell fusion in negative control group, in which 293T/MERS/EGFP cells were replaced by 293T/EGFP cells.

The fused cell was much larger by at least two fold than the unfused cell, and the intensity of fluorescence in the fused cell was weakerthan that of the unfused cell as a result of the diffusion of EGFP from one cell totwo or more cells (see Fig. 5a).

The cell fusion was imaged using an invertedfluorescencemicroscope at different time points (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 12 h).The fused cells were identified by measuring the enhanced greenfluorescent protein (EGFP)fluorescence intensity, which is at least 1-fold lower in fused cells than intact cells. The number of cell fusionswas calculated using the Image J software. The fusion rates (F) werecalculated using the following formula:N/T℅100%, where※N§represents the number of fused cells and※T§represents the totalnumber of 293T cells. 

Inhibition of MERS-CoV S2 Subunit-Mediated Cell Fusion : 293T/MERS/EGFP or 293T/EGFP cells (2℅10^4) were pretreatedwith HR1 inhibitors for 30 min and then added into the Huh-7 cells(5℅10^4). After co-culture at 37～C for 6 h, the cell fusions wereimaged using afluorescence microscope. The number of cell fusionswere calculated using the Image J software. The fusion rates (FP,FH,FN) were calculated using the following formula:F/A℅100%, where※F§represents the number of fused cells,※A§represents the totalnumber of 293T cells,※FP§represents the cell fusion rate between293T/MERS/EGFP and Huh-7 cells in the absence of HR1inhibitors,※FH§represents the cell fusion rate between 293T/MERS/EGFP cells and Huh-7 cells in the presence of HR1 inhibitors,※FN§represents the cell fusion rate between 293T/EGFP cells andHuh-7 cells in the absence of HR1 inhibitors. The inhibition rate (I)of cell fusions was calculated using the following formula: (FP?FH)/(FP?FN)℅100%. The concentration for 50% inhibition (IC50) wascalculated using the IBM SPSS software. 

MERS-CoV infects the host cells through S2 subunitinduced membrane fusion : During infections, the HR1 and HR2 domains in the S2 subunit form a 6-HB fusion core, which is responsive for membrane fusion between MERS-CoV and host cells. Therefore, inhibiting the formation of 6-HB is a promising method against MERS-CoV infections. However, MERS-CoV belongs to a family of viruses that can infect a variety of mammalian hosts and is readily transmissible among humans by direct contact with respiratory secretions, body fluids, and excretions from infected individuals. Consequently, the containment level 3 is required for all in vitro and in vivo studies, significantly hindering the development of anti-MERS treatments. We therefore constructed the cell fusion model to systemically evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of anti-MERS agents. It has been reported that Huh-7 cells showed higher susceptibility to MERS-CoV than respiratory tract cells, and, therefore, we constructed the cell fusion model with 293T cells co-expressed with EGFP/S protein and Huh-7 cells with MERS-CoV receptor DPP4. We thus performed the experiments to verify whether PIH could inhibit the cell fusion mediated by S2 subunit. The cellular size of 293T cells (MERS/EGFP) increased after fusing with Huh-7 cells, and the fused cells showed at least 2-fold lower fluorescence intensity compared to that of 293T cells (EGFP) (Figure 4a), indicating that S proteins on the 293T cells could recognize DPP4 on Huh-7 cells to induce cell fusion. In addition, we further identified that cell fusion between 293T and Huh-7 cells showed time-dependence, and reached the plateau after 6h (Figure 4b). Based on this established cell fusion model, we further investigated the inhibitory effects of PIH on S2 subunit-mediated cell fusion at 6 h after co-culture. Figure 4c,d shows that PIH had a dose-dependent responding profile with IC50 of 1.171 米M and could completely inhibit the cell fusion at a concentration of 10 米M, indicating that PIH has a high inhibitory activity for MERS-CoV infections.

Two hundred TCID50 of wild-type SARS-CoV were co-incubated with 50 米l peptides of different concentrations at 37 ～C for 30 min. The mixture was then transferred to 96-well plates, eight wells for each dilution. After incubation for 60 h, a MTT assay was then performed as described previously(PMID: 8450240). Briefly, 10 米l dimethylthiazol diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) (5 mg/ml) (Sigma每Aldrich) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h. The medium in each well was then replaced with 100 米l DMSO and the plates stayed at room temperature for 10 min for color development before being read by a BioRad Model 550 ELISA reader (using a test wavelength of 570 nm and a reference wavelength of 630 nm).",,15184046,,NO,,,,,,

When the monolayer was established, the growth medium was decanted and the various dilutions of test compound were added to each well (3 wells/dilution, 0.1 ml/well). Compound diluent medium was added to cell and virus control wells (0.1 ml/well). Virus (viral multiplicity of infection [MOI] = 0.01 to 0.001), diluted in test medium, was added to compound test wells (3 wells/dilution of compound) and to virus control wells at 0.1 ml/well. Virus was added approximately 5 min after compound. Test medium without virus was added to all toxicity control wells (2 wells/dilution of each test compound) and to cell control wells at 0.1 ml/well. The plates were incubated at 37～C or at 33～C (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-299E, and HCoV-NL63) in a humidified incubator with a 5% CO2-95% air atmosphere until virus control wells had adequate cytopathic effect (CPE) readings. This was achieved in 3 to 10 days after virus exposure to cells, depending on the virus. Cells were then examined microscopically for CPE, this being scored from 0 (normal cells) to 4 (maximal, 100% CPE). The cells in the toxicity control wells were observed microscopically for morphological changes attributed to cytotoxicity. This cytotoxicity was also graded as T (100% toxicity, complete cell sloughing from plate), PVH (80% cytotoxicity), PH (60% cytotoxicity), P (40% cytotoxicity), PSl (20% cytotoxicity), and 0 (normal cells).

Accordingly, to assess the inhibitory activities of 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P, we established a cell-cell fusion model. To accomplish this, we used Huh-7 cells, naturally expressing the APN receptor of HCoV-229E on the cell surface, and 293T cells that simultaneously coexpress HCoV-229E S protein on the cell surface and Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) in the cytoplasm (293T/229E/EGFP) as the target and effector cells, respectively (Figure 3a). After coculture of effector cells (293T/229E/EGFP) and target cells (Huh-7) at 37 ～C for 3 to 6 h, we could observe cells that had apparently fused, using fluorescence microscopy, which showed larger size and weaker fluorescence than unfused cells. This can be explained by the diffusion of fluorescence into one or more cells that fuse together (Figure 3b). After staining with 4∩,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), we could clearly see several nuclei in one fused cell. However, each of the 293T/229E/EGFP cells cultured alone contained only one single nucleus, suggesting that the effector cells cannot spontaneously fuse with each other or do not undergo propagating divisions to influence the assessment of fusion. Besides, 293T/EGFP cells that express no HCoV-229E S protein on cell surface could not fuse with the target cells, and each of these cells also contained only one nucleus.

In principle, both MPER and IFP are exposed during viral entry, and their association with a MPERderived peptide could inhibit the progression of viral entry and infection. For safety reasons, the inhibitory activity of M-wt peptide was tested in neutralization assays using avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), instead of SARS-CoV. IBV contains the same MPER sequence and undergoes a fusion process synonymous to that of SARS-CoV. Specifically, the assay was conducted on recombinant IBV-Luc, which contains a firefly luciferase gene integrated at its ORF3a3b. Successful viral entry and subsequent replication of IBV-Luc were assessed by intracellular luciferase activity. The MPER peptide derived from IBV, M-ibv (LKTYIKWPWYVWLAIAF), was tested in parallel. Increasing concentrations of synthetic MPER peptides (0, 12, 25, and 50 米M) were mixed with IBV-Luc for 1 h at 37 ～C and applied to Vero E6 cells seeded in a 96-well plate at 1 PFU.

Deep sequencing identified three ACE2 helix scaffolded designs (※approach 1§), and 105 de novo interface designs (※approach 2§) that were enriched after fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for RBD binding. All three ACE2-scaffolded designs and 12 of the de novo designs were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified.

Affinity maturation of the ACE2-scaffolded design by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mutagenesis led to a variant, AHB1, which bound RBD with an affinity of ~1 nM (fig.

To obtain the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, the cells were transfected with the HIV-1 Env-deleted proviral backbone plasmid pNL4-3忖Env-NanoLuc DNA and the pSARS-CoV-2-S忖19 plasmid (30). For the VSV-G pseudovirus, the cells were transfected with the Env-deleted proviral backbone plasmid pNL4-3.Luc.R-E- DNA and the pHEF-VSV-G envelope expression vector. Pseudovirus-containing supernatants were collected 2 days after transfection and filtered, their titers were determined, and they were stored in aliquots at ?80～C. Pseudovirus titers were determined to identify the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) by infecting different cell types.

Analysis of the incorporation of spike proteins into SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus :To confirm the incorporation of the spike protein into the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, 2?ml of the pseudovirus-containing supernatant was ultracentrifuged for 2 h at 38,000?rpm on a 20% sucrose cushion to concentrate the viral particles. Viral pellets were lysed and processed for protein analysis. The viral proteins were resolved on a NuPAGE Novex 4 to 12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and immunodetected with a SARS spike protein antibody (NB-100-56578; Novus Biological, Littleton, CO). An anti-rabbit-IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked whole antibody (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) was used as a secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized using chemiluminescence. Additionally, the correlation of the pseudovirus SARS-CoV-2 with the expression of the ACE2 receptor was analyzed by infecting five different cell types expressing different amounts of the ACE2 receptor with the same volume of the pseudovirus-containing supernatant. Briefly, 50 米l of SARS-CoV-2 diluted with 50 米l serum-free medium was added to wells of a 96-well cell culture plate.
